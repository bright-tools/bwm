Bright Window Manager (BWM)
===========================

What's it For?
--------------

BWM's purpose is to speed up the task of moving windows around by allowing
you to perform operations like moving & re-sizing without needing to click on
the titlebar or frame of the window (you hold down shortcut keys and then click
anywhere in the Window).

What does it Do?
----------------

Window manager (WM) extensions for Windows:
  * Left-click and drag (anywhere in the window, not just the titlebar) with keyboard modifiers held down to move a window
  * Right-click and drag (anywhere in the window, not just the frame) with keyboard modifiers held down to resize a window
  * Double-left click with keyboard modifiers held down to maximise/restore a window
  * Double-right click with keyboard modifiers held down to minimise a window
  * Automatic "snapping" to the edges of the screen and other windows when moving or resizing

Keyboard modifers (and mouse button bindings) can be configured by selecting "Options" after right-clicking
on the notification icon in the task area.

Dependencies
============

You'll need
  * [.NET 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30653)
  * [Visual C Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

The installer should tell you about these, but I've found that it's not as
reliable as would be desired.
