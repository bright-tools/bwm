Bright Window Manager (BWM)
===========================

Window manager (WM) extensions for Windows:
  * Left-click and drag with keyboard modifiers held down to move a window
  * Right-click and drag with keyboard modifiers held down to resize a window
  * Double-left click with keyboard modifiers held down to maximise/restore a window
  * Double-right click with keyboard modifiers held down to minimise a window
  * Automatic "snapping" to the edges of the screen and other windows when moving or resizing

Keyboard modifers (and mouse button bindings) can be configured by selecting "Options" after right-clicking
on the notification icon in the task area.
